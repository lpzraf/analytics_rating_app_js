# Analytics Rating App  

The Analytics Rating App is a basic web application built with Ruby On Rails, Bootstrap and a SQLite database. It started as a personal curated list of classes I've taken for all things digital analytics, plus how I ranked them, but it can be used by anyone else. Create a profile and rate away your favorite analytics resources!
